## Overview
PiScale Weight Display is a Python application designed to visualize weight measurements from a Mi Scale device on a Raspberry Pi with a touchscreen interface. Developed by Dr. Mohammed Salameh, this project provides a user-friendly solution for monitoring weight data in real-time. The application leverages Python, Tkinter, and the miScale module to create an interactive interface optimized for Raspberry Pi setups.

## Features
- Real-time display of weight measurements from a Mi Scale device.
- Interactive graphical interface tailored for Raspberry Pi touchscreen displays.
- Seamless integration with the Mi Scale device using the miScale module.
- Customizable appearance and behavior to suit individual preferences.
- Simple setup and execution, ideal for users with minimal programming experience.

## Requirements
- Raspberry Pi with a touchscreen display.
- Python 3.x installed on the Raspberry Pi.
- Tkinter library for GUI development (typically included with Python).
- miScale module for interfacing with the Mi Scale device.

## Usage
1. Connect your Raspberry Pi to the Mi Scale device via Bluetooth.
2. Run the Python script (`mi_scale_weight_display.py`) on the Raspberry Pi.
3. Click the "Run MiScale" button on the touchscreen interface to initialize the connection with the Mi Scale.
4. View real-time weight measurements displayed on the touchscreen.
5. Customize the appearance and behavior of the application as needed.

## Application Scenarios
- Health Monitoring: Track weight changes over time for personal health management.
- Fitness Tracking: Monitor weight fluctuations during workout routines and fitness programs.
- Smart Home Integration: Integrate weight measurements into home automation systems for smart health monitoring.
- Educational Purposes: Demonstrate real-time data visualization concepts using Raspberry Pi and Python.
